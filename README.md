# Draft U.S. Web Design Standards

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/18F/web-design-standards.svg?branch=18f-pages-staging)](https://travis-ci.org/18F/web-design-standards)

The [Draft U.S. Web Design Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards) is a library of open source UI components and a visual style guide for U.S. federal government websites.

These tools follow industry-standard web accessibility guidelines and reuse the best practices of existing style libraries and modern web design. Created and maintained by [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov) designers and developers, the Draft Web Design Standards are designed to support government product teams in creating beautiful and easy-to-use online experiences for the American people. Learn more about this project in our announcement [blog post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/28/web-design-standards/).

Design files of all the assets included on this site are available for download here: [https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards-assets](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards-assets).

To begin using the Draft Web Design Standards (to help you contribute to it or reuse it for your own purposes), go to [Getting Started](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards#getting-started). To run the [Draft Web Design Standards website](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/) locally on your machine, go to [Setup for your local environment](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/#setup-for-your-local-environment).

### Reuse of open source style guides

Much of the guidance in Draft Web Design Standards leans on open source designs, code, and patterns from other civic and government organizations, including:
- Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s [Design Manual](https://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/)
- U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s [Design Patterns](http://uspto.github.io/designpatterns/)
- Healthcare.gov [Style Guide](http://styleguide.healthcare.gov/)
- UK’s Government Digital Service’s [UI Elements](http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/)
- Code for America’s [Chime Styleguide](https://github.com/chimecms/chime-starter)
- Pivotal Labs [Component Library](http://styleguide.cfapps.io/)

## Getting started

To begin using the Draft Web Design Standards on your project, include the CSS and JavaScript files in each HTML page in your project. Download the Draft Web Design Standards assets: https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/archive/v0.8.3.zip. Add the `dist` directory files into a relevant places in your code base.

```
- dist
  - fonts/
  - img/
  - js/
  - css/
```

Refer to these files by adding a `<link>` and a `<script>` element into your HTML pages:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/your/assets/css/main.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/your/assets/css/google-fonts.css">
<script src="/path/to/your/assets/js/components.js"></script>
```

### Install with NPM

If you have `node` installed on your machine, you can use `npm` to install the Web Design Standards. In your `package.json` list the following under `dependencies`:

```json
  "uswds": "git@github.com:18F/web-design-standards.git#v0.8.3"
```

On subsequent runs of `npm install`, the package will be installed in `node_modules` under `uswds`. The CSS will be *not* compiled after it is installed. Instead, you are able to compile it however it fits into your project.

An `npm` task called `build-sass` is supplied, though you are not required to use it, that will compile the Sass to a CSS file named `uswds.css` (in `node_modules/uswds/assets/css/uswds.css`).

If you simply want to compile the Sass you could do something like:

`cd node_modules/uswds && npm run build-sass`

Note: You might get an [`npm` warning related to `lodash`](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/pull/902#issuecomment-161076213), but you can generally ignore it.

## Setup for your local environment

### Requirements

These setup instructions are for running the [Draft Web Design Standards website](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/) locally on your machine and not for using the assets (CSS, JavaScript, etc) on your own project. If you want to use the standards assets, go to [Getting Started](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards#getting-started). For context, the styleguide website uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (a static site generator), which is run via a [`./go` script](https://github.com/18F/go_script). At 18F, we then use [18F Pages](https://github.com/18F/pages) to publish and serve the site.

You will need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) ( > version 2.2.3 ). You may consider using a Ruby version manager such as [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or [rvm](https://rvm.io/) to help ensure that Ruby version upgrades don't mean all your [gems](https://rubygems.org/) will need to be rebuilt.

On OS X, you can also use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install Ruby in `/usr/local/bin`, which may require you to update your `$PATH` environment variable. Here are the commands to follow to install via homebrew:

```shell
$ brew update
$ brew install ruby
```

Note: The website is published with [18F Pages](https://github.com/18F/pages).

### Installation

Now that you have verified that you have Ruby installed, clone and run the following [go script](https://github.com/18F/go_script) commands to initialize and serve the library locally.

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:18F/web-design-standards.git
$ cd web-design-standards
$ npm install
$ gulp website:watch
```

You should now be able to visit `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`
and view the draft web design standards locally.

Questions or need help with setup? Did you run into any weird errors while following these instructions? Feel free to open an issue here: [https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/issues](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/issues).

### Gulp work flow

The Draft Web Design Standards repository includes `gulp` to help with the
automation of certain tasks. Once the project is installed on your local
machine, you can run `gulp` within the project directory and see all available
commands.

## Contributing to the code base

See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Deployment and workflow

* The staging branch `18f-pages-staging` is **automatically deployed** to our staging site: https://pages-staging.18f.gov/designstandards/.
* The production branch `18f-pages` is **automatically deployed** to our production site: https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/.

**All development and pull requests should be done against the `18f-pages-staging` branch.**

`18f-pages-staging` is already set to the default branch in this repository.

Deployments to production will be done by site admins, using pull requests from `18f-pages-staging` to `18f-pages`.
